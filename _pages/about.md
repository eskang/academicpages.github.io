I am excited to be joining [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/) in Fall 2018! I will be a member of the [Institute for Software Research](http://www.isri.cmu.edu/).

Until then, I will be a Researcher at [Toyota ITC](http://www.us.toyota-itc.com/) in Mountain View, CA, working on the safety and security of intelligent vehicles.

Research
======

I am interested in finding better ways to design software systems that are safe, secure and reliable. In particular, I spend a lot of time thinking about: (1) How do complex systems interact with our environment, and what makes their behavior so hard to predict? (2) What potential harm could they cause? (3) How do we design these systems to be more predictable & minimize the impact of their failures?

To this end, I am interested in a wide range of techniques from software engineering and programming languages, with a focus on software modeling, automated reasoning, design methodologies, and language mechanisms.

Short Bio
======

I received a Ph.D. and S.M. in Computer Science from MIT, and a Bachelor of Software Engineering from the University of Waterloo. Prior to joining CMU, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan and University of California, Berkeley. The work done by my colleagues and I have been recognized with one Best Paper Award ([CPS Week 2017](https://cpsweek2017.ece.cmu.edu/)) and two ACM Distinguished Paper Awards ([FSE'16](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/fse2016/), [ICSE'15](http://2015.icse-conferences.org/)).
